How did I set this up? Ok so I'm not starting completely at the beginning. I do know how to use a mouse and keyboard quite well, and I know a few handy keyboard shortcuts.

My first goal is to set up a nice readme file. I've noticed that it is the first thing that people (and myself) will see when coming to my Hub of knowledge and I want to be welcoming, interesting, and eye-catching.

I just learned while writing this that there is no spell check while typing directly into documents on GitHub!? Google time.

Google points me here: https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/issues/693. At the time it was an open issue [unresolved]. I suppose I'm giving up a bit quickly, but I have other ways to spell check my documents so lets leave this for now.

Back to the readme file. 
The basics of writing and formating syntax is a good reference to start: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax
A Markdown Cheatsheet is also helpful: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet

However, I am not in favor of this approach. I like an example to start with. So, I go find one! Hey look!. https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md

I don't know what this is for, but it's mine to explore.
