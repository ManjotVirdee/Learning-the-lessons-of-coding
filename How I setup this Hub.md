How did I set this up? Ok so I'm not starting completely at the beginning. I do know how to use a mouse and keyboard quite well, and I know a few handy keyboard shortcuts.

My first goal is to set up a nice readme file. I've noticed that it is the first thing that people (and myself) will see when coming to my Hub of knowledge and I want to be welcoming, interesting, and eye-catching.

I just learned while writing this that there is no spell check while typing directly into documents on GitHub!? Google time.

Google points me here: https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/issues/693. At the time it was an open issue [unresolved]. I suppose I'm giving up a bit quickly, but I have other ways to spell check my documents so let's leave this for now.

Back to the readme file. 
The basics of writing and formating syntax is a good reference to start: [Basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
A [Markdown Cheat](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) sheet is also helpful:

However, I am not in favor of this approach. I like an example to start with. So, I go find one! Hey look!. https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md

I don't know what this is for, but it's mine to explore.

So here I am looking at the raw file `Contributing.md` and trying out some of its formatting!! This is much more fun than reading through a formatting document!

# And from on HIGH I see all!

This is a header! Which makes all this subject to that header. Or maybe literary art doesn't need to be connected so stringently...?

## A smaller header
### and an even smaller header
#### the smallest of headers
##### no joke! this is tiny!
###### is this the most tiny!? 
####### yes, yes that is the most tiny. 

Why do some headers have lines under them? It seems to only be the biggest header [h1] and the sub header [h2].

So I can't check anything until I commit the changes. That is a little annoying. : (
* Check for existing ways to do what you want
 * try google!?
 * *gasp* I found something! Its so cool that I can just go online and find the answer to a question that's been floating around my head!
I found a thing called [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/app#). 

Which is a website app that let's you explore markdown side-by-side!!!!!!!
